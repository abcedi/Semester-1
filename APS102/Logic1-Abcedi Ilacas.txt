1. Start 

 
#Assuming initialization of variables has already been done
#Calculate scores of players
2. Calculate player1_score as the total successful baskets made by player1 

3. Calculate player2_score as the total successful baskets made by player2 

 

#Determine a winner and a loser, and also increment any ties 
4. If player1_score > player2_score: 

	a) Set winner to “Player 1”
	b) Set loser to "Player 2" 

5. If player2_score > player1_score: 

	a) Set winner to “Player 2”
	b) Set loser to "Player 1"  

6. If player1_score == player2_score: 

	a) Increment tied_games by 1 

 

#Calculate dollars owed 
7. Calculate dollars_owed as (player1_score - player2_score) 

8. Reduce dollars_owed by (tied_games * 0.5) 

9. If dollars_owed < 0: 

	a) Set dollars_owed to 1.00 

 

#Outputs/displays results
