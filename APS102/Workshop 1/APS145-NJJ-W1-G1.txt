1. Start

2. Initialize tied_games to 0
3. Initialize dollars_owed to 0
4. Initialize player1_score to 0
5. Initialize player2_score to 0
6. Initialize attempts to 0

7. Prompt Player1 to enter number on dice
8. Store value to num1
9. Prompt Player2 to enter number on dice
10. Store value to num2
11. if num1 == num2:
	a. go back to step 7
12. if num1 > num2:
	a. Display "Player1 goes first"
13. else
	a. Display "Player2 goes first"

14. if player1 goes first:

	while attempts<=4

		a)Player 1 make a throw and see if its successful
		b)if yes, increment Player1_score by 1

		c)Player 2 make a throw and see if its successful
		d)if yes, increment Player2_score by 1
		e)increment attempts by 1

15. if player2 goes first:

	while attempts<=4

		a)Player 2 make a throw and see if its successful
		b)if yes, increment Player2_score by 1

		c)Player 1 make a throw and see if its successful
		d)if yes, increment Player1_score by 1
		e)increment attempts by 1


16. Calculate player1_score as the total successful baskets made by player1 

17. Calculate player2_score as the total successful baskets made by player2 

18. If player1_score > player2_score: 

	a) Set winner to “Player 1”

19. If player2_score > player1_score: 

	a) Set winner to “Player 2” 

20. If player1_score == player2_score: 

	a) Increment tied_games by 1 
	b) Go back to step 14

21. Calculate dollars_owed as (player1_score - player2_score) 

22. Reduce dollars_owed by (tied_games * 0.5) 

23. If dollars_owed < 0: 

	a) Set dollars_owed to 1.00 

24. Output winner as the overall winner 

25. Output dollars_owed as the amount owed by the losing player to the winner
