1. Start

2. Initialize tied_games to 0
3. Initialize dollars_owed to 0
4. Initialize player1_score to 0
5. Initialize player2_score to 0
6. Initialize player1_attempts to 0
6. Initialize player2_attempts to 0

6. Prompt Player1 to enter number on dice
7. Store value to num1
8. Prompt Player2 to enter number on dice
9. Store value to num2
10. if num1 == num2:
	a. go back to step 6
11. if num1 > num2:
	a. Display "Player1 goes first"
12. else
	a. Display "Player2 goes first"

13.For each of the 4 attempts for Player1
(i) make a throw and see if its successful
if yes, increment Player1_score by 1
increment player1_attempts by 1
14.For each of the 4 attempts for Player2
(ii) make a throw and see if its successful
if yes, increment Player2_score by 1
increment player2_attempts by 1


15. Calculate player1_score as the total successful baskets made by player1 

16. Calculate player2_score as the total successful baskets made by player2 

17. If player1_score > player2_score: 

	a) Set winner to “Player 1”

18. If player2_score > player1_score: 

	a) Set winner to “Player 2” 

19. If player1_score == player2_score: 

	a) Increment tied_games by 1 
	b) Go back to step 13

20. Calculate dollars_owed as (player1_score - player2_score) 

21. Reduce dollars_owed by (tied_games * 0.5) 

22. If dollars_owed < 0: 

	a) Set dollars_owed to 1.00 

23. Output winner as the overall winner 

24. Output dollars_owed as the amount owed by the losing player to the winner
