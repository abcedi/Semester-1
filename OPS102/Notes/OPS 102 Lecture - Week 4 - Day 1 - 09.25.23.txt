OPS102 | Saso Kocev | Week 4 - Day 1 - 09.25.23

quiz #3: based on wildcards, compare to files, replace tex in files, text readers.

how to replace file again? mv command? tr command

commands:
file filename - shows file format.

symbolic
Permissions 
r = Read - see
w = Write - change
x = Execute - run
d = directory

ls -l - shows permissions
you will see: -rw-r--r--(rwxrwxrwx) saso.kocev users  (first dash could be file type)
the first three dashes is the permissions of the user - saso.kocev
the second three sets dashes is the groups related to the user and allowed by the user - users
last set of three dashes is the people outside the group or others

commands:
chmod - or chmod + - add and remove commands
example: chmod -w file - removes write permission
chmod -r - removes all permission

x - could be only used in executable programs but it could still be used in regular files and gives them executable permissions and changes its color.

+w = default gives it to user
+r and +x = gives it to everyone

to give permssions to specific people:
u = user
g = group
o = others
a = all
example: chmod o-r - removes read for the others

you can give or remove multple types of permission to a group
example: chmod u+rwx - gives read, write, execute to user only.

you cna also give and remove in the same line:
chmod o-r,o+w file - removes read and add write permission on file
or chmod o-r,o+wx or chmod o-r,o+w,o+x file

chmod arg1 arg2
chmod +r file
DONT put spaces on the argument 1 instead put a comma

you can also combine permission with wildcards
chmod o-x,o+rx file*

you can also combine this when giving or removing permissions for specific:
chmod g-o-x,o+rx file*
or chmod g-r,o+r file* or chmod go-r file or chmod ugo+rwx file

if your going to use ugo for specific then just use a
chmod a-r file

= - set symbol, it turns on only that specific permission (shortcut)
example: chmod g=rw filr - only turn on read and write for the group section
