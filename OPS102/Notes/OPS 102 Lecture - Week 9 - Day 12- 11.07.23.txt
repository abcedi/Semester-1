Week 9 | OPS102 |
In your home directory and any subdirectories, locate files named review.txt, Review.txt, or REVIEW.TXT. Append the all results to the bottom of a file called log.txt

My answer:
find ~ -ir "review.txt" >> log.txt

Actual answer
find ~ -iname "review.txt" >> log.txt

#!/bin/bash

name=Saso //initializing variable

echo "Hello &name" // & is like % but instead you type the variable name after

1. create file		nano ./hello2.sh
2. give permission	chmod u+x
3. run command		./hello2.sh
4. show code		cat -n hello2.sh

strong quotes ' ' - outputs the value of the variables.
weak quotes " " - outputs the actual/exact text in the code.(i.e. shows actual variable name)

school="Seneca College"
reads the space
good practice to use weak quotes when initializing variables
variables are case sensitive

favourite="My favourite college is $school" //nested variables

#!/bin/bash

school="Seneca" //make sure the varible is in the script in order for it to word

echo "My school is $school"

Scripts run from top to buttom.

env - environment variables

export var=value - adds to the the environment variable
doesn't have to be in script
