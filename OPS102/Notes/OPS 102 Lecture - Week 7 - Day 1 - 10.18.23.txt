grep - find a key word (example grep "nutella" food.txt - if you want to search in a specific help or grep -r "nutella" ~/ndm - you want to scan multple files in a recursive order meaing going down sub folders to search for words)
find - looks for file names (example: find ~ -name "thursday.txt") command > file location to start > -name or -iname > file name
- only goes down directories

sort text.txt - sorts alphabetically
sort -n num.txt - -n for sort numeric values
sort -nr num.txt - -r for reverse 
sort -f food.txt - -f sort dismissing capitilazation

tail -f food.txt - shows update lines
tail -f food.txt & - & makes it run in the background

what courses you teach
who was the teacher that made the videos

For OOP I would either recommend Fardad Soleimanloo or Chris Szalwinski. For WEB, definitely go with David Humphrey. These three professors really know their stuff and they are good at teaching.

Try to avoid Nargis Khan at all costs.

I am definitely taking OSD600, and then 700 next semester.

focus on permissions, tree
