review for quiz 4:

7. Using octal permissions change the file permissions for a file called linux.txt
User read and write
Group read and execute
Others nothing

my answer:
chmod 650

chmod 650 linux.txt (dont forget the file at the end)

4. You are friend is worried that anyone can access his homework.txt file. Using symbolic set permissions, advise your friend a command that will only give permissions for this file to himself (read and edit). Nobody else should access this file in any way. 
The file should only give him permissions to read and make changes to the file.

my answer:
chmod u=rw

chmod u=rw,g=,o= homework.txt
chmod u=rw,go= homework.txt

chmod u+rwx,g+rw,g-x,o+r,o-wx linux.txt
chmod u+rwx,g+rw-x,o+r-wx linux.txt


9. Search for a file name called matrix in the /home directory, and export all error messages to a file called errors.txt
my answer:
ls /home/matrix > errors.txt

find /home -name "matrix" 2> error.txt

'2' works with error messages, means error message also goes to the file rather than displaying in the screen
find finds file burried under many directories ls only in current directory

question 2

Command:
umask [binary numbers] - changes permissions of the newly created files
