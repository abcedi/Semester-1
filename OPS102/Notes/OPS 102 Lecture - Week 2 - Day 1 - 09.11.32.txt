root dir - only admistrator, root of the linux
home dir - regular users
~ - represents home directory
tree - shows all the files into a tree diagram
tree -C - shows the heirarcy (capital C for colors)
	- blue (directory), white (file), green (executable file), light blue 	(shortcuts), red (broken link), pink (pictures)


- you can't skip folders, you need to go one by one
- but you can type it all at once by typing cd /home/ammendoza2
- another shortcut is to type cd ~ and it goes back your homecd  

ls -l --sort time
ls -l --sort size


when there is a slash /in cd to indicate that it is a directory

you can go down quickly if you know the absolute address example cd /bin but only from the top of the hierarcy going down

absolute path - complete address
relative to home path - ~ to home

ask about relative and absolute path? Answer absolute always start at the root and relative always where you are currently at

cp ~/ndm/homework/lab1 ~/ndm/homework/thursday/lab2
if you dont name it in the final line then it will take the same file name as the original

cp -r - to copy directory and everything inside
mv - rename file mv file1 file2
mv - moving file1 homework/file1
. - current directory
rm - remove files
rm -r - remove directory
rmdir - removes empty directories

you can have multiple file with the same name but different capitalizations

how can you differenciate renaming and moving in linux?
